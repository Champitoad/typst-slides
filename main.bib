  abstract  = {Lean 4 is a reimplementation of the Lean interactive theorem prover (ITP) in Lean itself. It addresses many shortcomings of the previous versions and contains many new features. Lean 4 is fully extensible: users can modify and extend the parser, elaborator, tactics, decision procedures, pretty printer, and code generator. The new system has a hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. It contains a new typeclass resolution procedure based on tabled resolution, addressing significant performance problems reported by the growing user base. Lean 4 is also an efficient functional programming language based on a novel programming paradigm called functional but in-place. Efficient code generation is crucial for Lean users because many write custom proof automation procedures in Lean itself.},

These linguistic approaches have a drawback: the languages are not generally portable, even though the nature of logical reasoning is universal. We propose a somewhat speculative alternative method that lets the user directly manipulate the text of the theorem, using non-linguistic metaphors. It uses a proof formalism based on linking subformulas, which is a variant of deep inference (inference rules are allowed to apply in any formula context) where the relevant formulas in a rule are allowed to be arbitrarily distant. We substantiate the design with a prototype implementation of a linking-based interactive prover for ﬁrst-order classical linear logic.},

The most popular proof assistants today all have user interfaces that are largely text-based. This leads to a steep learning curve for new users of these tools. In this paper, we propose a framework for designing user interfaces for proof assistants based on pointing and clicking. While a main goal of the design is ease of learning for new users, we intend for the design to be suitable for real verification tasks. The design is also extensible, allowing custom proof methods and search functionality to be added in a convenient way. We implement our ideas in a web interface, with backend provided by holpy, a new system for interactive theorem proving implemented in Python. The resulting user interface is tested on theorems in logic, sets, functions, Peano arithmetic, and lists, demonstrating its applicability in a wide range of areas.},

Peirce invented two types of logical systems, one symbolic and the other graphical. In this book Sun-Joo Shin explores the philosophical roots of the birth of Peirce's Existential Graphs in his theory of representation and logical notation. Shin demonstrates that Peirce is the first philosopher to lay a solid philosophical foundation for multimodal representation systems.Shin analyzes Peirce's well-known, but much-criticized nonsymbolic representation system. She presents a new approach to his graphical system based on her discovery of its unique nature and on a reconstruction of Peirce's theory of representation. By seeking to understand graphical systems on their own terms, she uncovers the reasons why graphical systems, and Existential Graphs in particular, have been underappreciated among logicians. Drawing on perspectives from the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, logic, and computer science, Shin provides evidence for a genuinely interdisciplinary project on multimodal reasoning.}},

Besides revealing dualities which are not immediately apparent in the traditional presentation of the presheaf hyperdoctrine, this reconstruction leads us to an axiomatic treatment of directed equality predicates (modelled by hom presheaves), realizing a vision initially set out by Lawvere (1970). It also leads to a simple calculus of string diagrams (representing presheaves) that is highly reminiscent of C. S. Peirce's existential graphs for predicate logic, refining an earlier interpretation of existential graphs in terms of Boolean hyperdoctrines by Brady and Trimble. Finally, we illustrate how this work extends to a bifibrational setting a number of fundamental ideas of linear logic.},

  abstract   = {In interactive theorem provers (ITPs), extensible syntax is not only crucial to lower the cognitive burden of manipulating complex mathematical objects, but plays a critical role in developing reusable abstractions in libraries. Most ITPs support such extensions in the form of restrictive "syntax sugar" substitutions and other ad hoc mechanisms, which are too rudimentary to support many desirable abstractions. As a result, libraries are littered with unnecessary redundancy. Tactic languages in these systems are plagued by a seemingly unrelated issue: accidental name capture, which often produces unexpected and counterintuitive behavior. We take ideas from the Scheme family of programming languages and solve these two problems simultaneously by proposing a novel hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. We further describe how our approach can be extended to cover type-directed macro expansion resulting in a single, uniform system offering multiple abstraction levels that range from supporting simplest syntax sugars to elaboration of formerly baked-in syntax. We have implemented our new macro system and integrated it into the new version of the Lean theorem prover, Lean 4. Despite its expressivity, the macro system is simple enough that it can easily be integrated into other systems.},

  abstract   = {In this paper I will discuss the fundamental ideas behind proof assistants: What are they and what is a proof anyway? I give a short history of the main ideas, emphasizing the way they ensure the correctness of the mathematics formalized. I will also brieﬂy discuss the places where proof assistants are used and how we envision their extended use in the future. While being an introduction into the world of proof assistants and the main issues behind them, this paper is also a position paper that pushes the further use of proof assistants. We believe that these systems will become the future of mathematics, where deﬁnitions, statements, computations and proofs are all available in a computerized form. An important application is and will be in computer supported modelling and veriﬁcation of systems. But there is still a long road ahead and I will indicate what we believe is needed for the further proliferation of proof assistants.},

  abstract  = {Text editing is powerful, but some types of expressions are more naturally represented and manipulated graphically. Examples include expressions that compute colors, music, animations, tabular data, plots, diagrams, and other domain-specific data structures. This paper introduces live literals, or livelits, which allow clients to fill holes of types like these by directly manipulating a user-defined GUI embedded persistently into code. Uniquely, livelits are compositional: a livelit GUI can itself embed spliced expressions, which are typed, lexically scoped, and can in turn embed other livelits. Livelits are also uniquely live: a livelit can provide continuous feedback about the run-time implications of the client’s choices even when splices mention bound variables, because the system continuously gathers closures associated with the hole that the livelit is filling. We integrate livelits into Hazel, a live hole-driven programming environment, and describe case studies that exercise these novel capabilities. We then define a simply typed livelit calculus, which specifies how livelits operate as live graphical macros. The metatheory of macro expansion has been mechanized in Agda.},

  abstract     = {The deep symmetry of Linear Logic 18] makes it suitable for providing abstract models of computation, free from implementation details which are, by nature, oriented and non symmetrical. I propose here one such model, in the area of Logic Programming, where the basic computational principle is Computation = Proof search. Proofs considered here are those of the Gentzen style sequent calculus for Linear Logic. However, proofs in this system may be redundant, in that two proofs can be syntactically di erent although identical up to some irrelevant reordering or simpli cation of the applications of the inference rules. This leads to an untractable proof search where the search procedure is forced to make costly choices which turn out to be irrelevant. To overcome this problem, a subclass of proofs, called the {\textbackslash}focusing" proofs, which is both complete (any derivable formula in Linear Logic has a focusing proof) and tractable (many irrelevant choices in the search are eliminated when aimed at focusing proofs) is identi ed. The main constraint underlying the speci cation of focusing proofs has been to preserve the symmetry of Linear Logic, which is its most salient feature. In particular, dual connectives have dual properties with respect to focusing proofs.},

Within linear logic, the focused proof system of Andreoli provides an elegant and comprehensive normal form for cut-free proofs. Within intuitionistic and classical logics, there are various diﬀerent proof systems in the literature that exhibit focusing behavior. These focused proof systems have been applied to both the proof search and the proof normalization approaches to computation. We present a new, focused proof system for intuitionistic logic, called {LJF}, and show how other intuitionistic proof systems can be mapped into the new system by inserting logical connectives that prematurely stop focusing. We also use {LJF} to design a focused proof system {LKF} for classical logic. Our approach to the design and analysis of these systems is based on the completeness of focusing in linear logic and on the notion of polarity that appears in Girard’s {LC} and {LU} proof systems.},

  abstract = { A methodology for computer assisted proof is presented with an example. A central ingredient in the method is the presentation of tactics (or strategies) in an algorithmic metalanguage. Further, the same language is also used to express combinators, by which simple elementary tactics - which often correspond to the inference rules of the logic employed - are combined into more complex tactics, which may even be strategies complete for a class of problems. However, the emphasis is not upon completeness but upon providing a metalogical framework within which a user may express his insight into proof methods and may delegate routine (but error-prone) work to the computer. This method of tactic composition is presented at the start of the paper in the form of an elementary theory of goal-seeking. A second ingredient of the methodology is the stratification of machine-assisted proof by an ancestry graph of applied theories, and the example illustrates this stratification. In the final section, some recent developments and applications of the method are cited. }

Requirements for formal descriptions of practical inference methods are now emerging however. For example, interactive reasoning systems are needed for verification of computer systems, and should support practically convenient reasoning techniques as strongly as possible. This paper describes a proof paradigm which formalises a hierarchical, problem-reduction style of reasoning which is widely useful in practical reasoning. It is a goal directed paradigm, which gives a central role to equivalence transformations. A hierarchy of subgoals can co-exist at a single point in the proof, and these subgoals may be of arbitrary type. The approach allows good access to contextual information when transforming subgoals, and can be applied to a variety of logics.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents work on technology for transformational proof and program development, as used by window inference calculi and transformation systems. The calculi are characterised by a certain class of theorems in the underlying logic. Our transformation system TAS compiles these rules to concrete deduction support, complete with a graphical user interface with command-language-free user interaction by gestures like drag\&drop and proof-by-pointing, and a development management for transformational proofs. It is generic in the sense that it is completely independent of the particular window inference or transformational calculus, and can be instantiated to many diﬀerent ones; three such instantiations are presented in the paper.},

Programming happens by gestural composition of TVs. Our goal is to give end-users the ability to create parameterized, composable content without imposing the usual abstract and linguistic working style of programmers. We hope that such a system will put the essence of programming into the hands of many more people, and in particular people with artistic/visual creative style.In realizing this vision, we develop algebras for visual presentation and for "deep" function application, where function and argument may both be nested within a structure of tuples, functions, etc. Composition gestures are translated into chains of combinators that act simultaneously on statically typed values and their visualizations.},

This book is both a concise introduction to the central results and methods of structural proof theory, and a work of research that will be of interest to specialists. The book is designed to be used by students of philosophy, mathematics and computer science. The book contains a wealth of results on proof-theoretical systems, including extensions of such systems from logic to mathematics, and on the connection between the two main forms of structural proof theory - natural deduction and sequent calculus. The authors emphasize the computational content of logical results. A special feature of the volume is a computerized system for developing proofs interactively, downloadable from the web and regularly updated.},

It is also convenient to use: it can just be added to an existing installation of the development tools. Already compiled libraries can be used directly, with no need to reinstall anything. Finally, some virtual machines are the target of several languages. A bytecode to Javascript compiler would make it possible to retarget all these languages to Web browsers at once.},

This language is based on a functional core with recursors and matching operators for Coq terms but also for proof contexts. It can be used directly in proof scripts or in toplevel definitions (tactic definitions). We show that the implementation of this language involves considerable changes in the interpretation of proof scripts, essentially due to the matching operators. We give some examples which solve small proof parts locally and some others which deal with non-trivial problems. Finally, we discuss the status of this meta-language with respect to the Coq language and the implementation language of Coq.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the use of deep inference formalisms as basis for a computational interpretation of proof systems, following the two main approaches: proofs-as-programs and proof-search-as-computation. The first contribution is the development of a family of proof systems for intuitionistic logic in the calculus of structures and in nested sequents, for which internal normalisation procedures are given. One of these procedure is then interpreted in terms of computation, as a refinement of the Curry-Howard correspondence allowing to introduce a form of sharing and communication operators in a lambda-calculus with explicit substitution. On the side of proof-search, the notion of focused proof in linear logic is transferred from the sequent calculus into the calculus of structures, where it yields an incremental form of focusing, with a simple proof of completeness. Finally, another interpretation of proof-search is given through the encoding of reduction in a lambda-calculus with explicit substitution into the inference rules of a subsystem of intuitionistic logic in the calculus of structures.},

  abstract  = {Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) described his philosophy as a kind of“logical atomism”, by which he meant to endorse both a metaphysicalview and a certain methodology for doing philosophy. The metaphysicalview amounts to the claim that the world consists of a plurality ofindependently existing things exhibiting qualities and standing inrelations. According to logical atomism, all truths are ultimatelydependent upon a layer of atomic facts, which consist either of asimple particular exhibiting a quality, or multiple simple particularsstanding in a relation. The methodological view recommends a process ofanalysis, whereby one attempts to define or reconstruct more complexnotions or vocabularies in terms of simpler ones. This process often revealsthat what we take to be brute necessities are instead purely logical. According to Russell,at least early on during his logical atomist phase, such an analysiscould eventually result in a language containing only wordsrepresenting simple particulars, the simple properties and relationsthereof, and logical constants, which, despite this limited vocabulary,could adequately capture all truths.},

In this article, we will survey the use of structural proof theory as an alternative foundation. Researchers have been using this foundation for the past 35 years to elevate logic programming from its roots in first-order classical logic into higher-order versions of intuitionistic and linear logic. These more expressive logic programming languages allow for capturing stateful computations and rich forms of abstractions, including higher-order programming, modularity, and abstract data types. Term-level bindings are another kind of abstraction, and these are given an elegant and direct treatment within both proof theory and these extended logic programming languages. Logic programming has also inspired new results in proof theory, such as those involving polarity and focused proofs. These recent results provide a high-level means for presenting the differences between forward-chaining and backward-chaining style inferences. Anchoring logic programming in proof theory has also helped identify its connections and differences with functional programming, deductive databases, and model checking.},

In an earlier paper I showed there was a strong connection between modal nested sequents and modal preﬁxed tableaux. In this paper I show the connection continues to intuitionistic logic, both standard and constant domain, relating nested intuitionistic sequent calculi to intuitionistic preﬁxed tableaux. Modal nested sequent machinery generalizes one sided sequent calculi—intuitionistic nested sequents similarly generalize two sided sequents. It is noteworthy that the resulting system for constant domain intuitionistic logic is particularly simple. It amounts to a combination of intuitionistic propositional rules and classical quantiﬁer rules, a combination that is known to be inadequate when conventional intuitionistic sequent systems are used.},

  abstract     = {In this thesis, we consider bi-intuitionistic logic and tense logic, as well as the combined bi-intuitionistic tense logic. Each of these logics contains a pair of dual connectives, for example, Rauszer's bi-intuitionistic logic contains intuitionistic implication and dual intuitionistic exclusion. The interaction between these dual connectives makes it non-trivial to develop a cut-free sequent calculus for these logics. In the first part of this thesis we develop a new extended sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic logic using a framework of derivations and refutations. This is the first purely syntactic cut-free sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic logic and thus solves an open problem. Our calculus is sound, semantically complete and allows terminating backward proof search, hence giving rise to a decision procedure for bi-intuitionistic logic. In the second part of this thesis we consider the broader problem of taming proof search in display calculi, using bi-intuitionistic logic and tense logic as case studies. While the generality of display calculi makes it an excellent framework for designing sequent calculi for logics where traditional sequent calculi fail, this generality also leads to a large degree of non-determinism, which is problematic for backward proof-search. We control this non-determinism in two ways: 1. First, we limit the structural connectives used in the calculi and consequently, the number of display postulates. Specifically, we work with nested structures which can be viewed as a tree of traditional Gentzen's sequents, called nested sequents, which have been used previously by Kashima and, independently, by Brunnler and Strafsburger and Poggiolesi to present several modal and tense logics; 2. Second, since residuation rules are largely responsible for the difficulty in finding a proof search procedure for display-like calculi, we show how to eliminate these residuation rules using deep inference in nested sequents; Finally, we study the combined bi-intuitionistic tense logic, which contains the well-known intuitionistic modal logic as a sublogic. We give a nested sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic tense logic that has cut-elimination, and a derived deep inference nested sequent calculus that is complete with respect to the first calculus and where contraction and residuation rules are admissible. We also show how our calculi can capture Simpson's intuitionistic modal logic [104] and Ewald's intuitionistic tense logic.},

We trace this confusion to the axiomatic formalism of RBiInt in which Rauszer first characterized bi-intuitionistic logic and show that, as in modal logic, RBiInt can be interpreted as two different consequence relations. We remove this ambiguity by using generalized Hilbert calculi, which are tailored to capture consequence relations. We show that RBiInt leads to two logics, wBIL and sBIL, with different extensional and meta-level properties, and that they are, respectively, sound and strongly complete with respect to the Kripkean local and global semantic consequence relations of bi-intuitionistic logic. Finally, we explain where they were conflated by Rauszer.},

  abstract = {This thesis provides a clarification of Girard's recent work entitled "transcendental syntax". Girard suggests a reorganisation and a reinterpretation of concepts of mathematical logic coming from his previous works on linear logic, proof-nets, ludics and geometry of interaction. Unlike the approaches of semantic explanations based on the linguistic nature of logical entities and their evaluation, transcendental syntax suggests to start from the notion of computation as primitive in order to reconstruct mathematical logic, by starting with the proof-nets of linear logic. The Curry-Howard correspondence, now well-known among theoretical computer scientists, already established a formal correspondence between logic and computation. However, the links between logic and computation are still unclear. Are they two faces of the same thing? Are they different but intersecting notions? Or are they completely distinct? This thesis agrees with the last point of view: one is antique and almost mystical, the other is rather modern and pragmatic. In order to understand their differences and their role, transcendental syntax proposes a radical point of view: no primitive notion of mathematical proof, truth or formula is assumed. Only computation, through the model of computation called "stellar resolution" in this thesis, constitutes the elementary bricks from which logical concepts will be shaped. This model of computation, close to logic programming, uses asynchronous and very free mechanisms of term unification. The main problem that this thesis tackles is that Girard's proposal is rather informal and cryptic. A big objective is to clarify and to provide formal definitions. A particular effort is put in the accessibility of these ideas by suggesting a journey through the old and elementary roots of logic and computation to later reach the most modern works. Girard's works will then be put into context in both a historical and technical ways. The model of stellar resolution will be formally defined, illustrated and commented. The thesis concludes with a technical contributions realised with Thomas Seiller: a new interpretation of the multiplicative fragment of linear logic and a sketch of how it could be extended.},

The main source of non-locality is the contraction rules. We show that the contraction rules can be restricted to the atomic ones, provided we employ deep-inference, i.e., to allow rules to apply anywhere inside logical expressions. We further show that the use of deep inference allows for modular extensions of intuitionistic logic to Dummett’s intermediate logic LC, Gödel logic and classical logic. We present the systems in the calculus of structures, a proof theoretic formalism which supports deep-inference. Cut elimination for these systems are proved indirectly by simulating the cut-free sequent systems, or the hypersequent systems in the cases of Dummett’s LC and Gödel logic, in the cut free systems in the calculus of structures.},

  abstract     = {This paper is an exercise in formal and philosophical logic. I will show how intuitionistic propositional logic can be extended with a new two-place connective, not expressible in the traditional language of intuitionistic logic (the language of conjunction, disjunction, negation and implication). The new system will be shown to be a conservative extension of intuitionistic logic. After examining the formal properties of this extension, the task will be to consider whether this is an `acceptable' extension of intuitionistic logic. It will turn out that on some intuitionistic considerations the extension is acceptable, and on others it is not. In this paper I presume that the reader has some idea both of the formal properties of intuitionistic logic, and some motivating philosophical principles which inform the development of intuitionistic logic. Readers wanting such an introduction can do no better than look at some of the excellent, extensive literature on intuitionism [3, 5, 8, 12]. Other work has been done on extending intuitionistic propositional logic with new connectives. Gabbay [6] considers extending the logic with propositional connectives. Our new connective is not one he considers. De Jongh too considers extending intuitionistic logic by adding arbitrary conjunction and disjunction. In his interesting paper [2] he shows that once you make such an addition to the basic logic, you end up with a proper class of propositional connectives expressible. In what follows we will consider adding just one new binary connective to the language of intuitintionistic propositional logic.},

Thanks to this mild modiﬁcation, tensorial logic provides a type-theoretic account of game semantics where innocent strategies are portrayed as temporal reﬁnements of traditional proof-nets in linear logic. In this paper, we study the algebraic and combinatorial structure of negation in a noncommutative variant of tensorial logic. The analysis is based on a 2-categorical account of dialogue categories, which uniﬁes tensorial logic with linear logic, and discloses a primitive symmetry between proofs and anti-proofs. The micrological analysis of tensorial negation reveals that it can be decomposed into a series of more elementary components: an adjunction L R between the left and right negation functors L and R ; a pair of linear distributivity laws κ and κ which reﬁnes the linear distributivity law between ⊗ and ` in linear logic, and generates the Opponent and Proponent views of innocent strategies between dialogue games ; a pair of axiom and cut combinators adapted from linear logic ; an involutive change of frame (−)∗ reversing the point of view of Prover and of Denier on the logical dispute, and reversing the polarity of moves in the dialogue game associated to the tensorial formula.},

  abstract = {We revisit the notion of intuitionistic equivalence and formal proof representations by adopting the view of formulas as exponential polynomials. After observing that most of the invertible proof rules of intuitionistic (minimal) propositional sequent calculi are formula (i.e. sequent) isomorphisms corresponding to the high-school identities, we show that one can obtain a more compact variant of a proof system, consisting of non-invertible proof rules only, and where the invertible proof rules have been replaced by a formula normalisation procedure. Moreover, for certain proof systems such as the G4ip sequent calculus of Vorob'ev, Hudelmaier, and Dyckhoff, it is even possible to see all of the non-invertible proof rules as strict inequalities between exponential polynomials; a careful combinatorial treatment is given in order to establish this fact. Finally, we extend the exponential polynomial analogy to the first-order quantifiers, showing that it gives rise to an intuitionistic hierarchy of formulas, resembling the classical arithmetical hierarchy, and the first one that classifies formulas while preserving isomorphism.},

  abstract = {In his formal papers on existential graphs, Peirce tended to obscure the simplicity of EGs with distracting digressions. In MS 514, however, he presented his simplest introduction to the EG syntax, semantics, and rules of inference. This article reproduces Peirce's original words and diagrams with further commentary, explanations, and examples. Unlike the syntax-based approach of most current textbooks, Peirce's method addresses the semantic issues of logic in a way that can be transferred to any notation. The concluding section shows that his rules of inference can clarify the foundations of proof theory and relate diverse methods, such as resolution and natural deduction. To relate EGs to other notations for logic, this article uses the Existential Graph Interchange Format (EGIF), which is a subset of the CGIF dialect of Common Logic. EGIF is a linear notation that can be mapped to and from the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants of EGs. It can also be translated to or from other formalisms, algebraic or geometrical.},

  abstract  = {In mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that no more than four colors are required to color the regions of any map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.  Adjacent means that two regions share a common boundary curve segment, not merely a corner where three or more regions meet. It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Initially, this proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand. The proof has gained wide acceptance since then, although some doubters remain.The four color theorem was proved in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken after many false proofs and counterexamples (unlike the five color theorem, proved in the 1800s, which states that five colors are enough to color a map). To dispel any remaining doubts about the Appel–Haken proof, a simpler proof using the same ideas and still relying on computers was published in 1997 by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas. In 2005, the theorem was also proved by Georges Gonthier with general-purpose theorem-proving software.},

  abstract  = {While many books have been written about Bertrand Russell's philosophy and some on his logic, I. Grattan-Guinness has written the first comprehensive history of the mathematical background, content, and impact of the mathematical logic and philosophy of mathematics that Russell developed with A. N. Whitehead in theirPrincipia mathematica (1910-1913).This definitive history of a critical period in mathematics includes detailed accounts of the two principal influences upon Russell around 1900: the set theory of Cantor and the mathematical logic of Peano and his followers. Substantial surveys are provided of many related topics and figures of the late nineteenth century: the foundations of mathematical analysis under Weierstrass; the creation of algebraic logic by De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, Schröder, and Jevons; the contributions of Dedekind and Frege; the phenomenology of Husserl; and the proof theory of Hilbert. The many-sided story of the reception is recorded up to 1940, including the rise of logic in Poland and the impact on Vienna Circle philosophers Carnap and Gödel. A strong American theme runs though the story, beginning with the mathematician E. H. Moore and the philosopher Josiah Royce, and stretching through the emergence of Church and Quine, and the 1930s immigration of Carnap and GödeI.Grattan-Guinness draws on around fifty manuscript collections, including the Russell Archives, as well as many original reviews. The bibliography comprises around 1,900 items, bringing to light a wealth of primary materials.Written for mathematicians, logicians, historians, and philosophers--especially those interested in the historical interaction between these disciplines--this authoritative account tells an important story from its most neglected point of view. Whitehead and Russell hoped to show that (much of) mathematics was expressible within their logic; they failed in various ways, but no definitive alternative position emerged then or since.},

In this paper, we examine the synthetic inference rules that arise when using theories composed of bipolars, and we do this in both classical and intuitionistic logics. A key step in transforming a formula into synthetic inference rules involves attaching a polarity to atomic formulas and to some logical connectives. Since there are diﬀerent choices in how polarity is assigned, it is possible to produce diﬀerent synthetic inference rules for the same formula. We show that this ﬂexibility allows for the generalization of diﬀerent approaches for transforming axioms into sequent rules present in the literature. We ﬁnish the paper showing how to apply these results to organize the proof theory of labeled sequent systems for several propositional modal logics.},

CL has a natural proof theory, reasoning is constructive and proof objects can easily be obtained. We prove completeness of the proof theory and give a linear translation from FOL to CL that preserves logical equivalence. These properties make CL well-suited for providing automated reasoning support to logical frameworks. The proof theory has been implemented in Prolog, generating proof objects that can be verified directly in the proof assistant Coq. The prototype has been tested on the proof of Hessenberg’s Theorem, which could be automated to a considerable extent. Finally, we compare the prototype to some automated theorem provers on selected problems.},

  abstract  = {The sequent calculus admits many proofs of the same conclusion that diﬀer from each other only by trivial permutations of inference rules. Those interested in the identity of proofs and the elimination of “bureaucracy” from proofs usually switch to proof nets or natural deduction formalisms in order to capture equivalence-under-permutations of sequent calculus proofs via more abstract and geometric structures. In this paper we recover canonicity directly in the sequent calculus by restricting Andreoli’s focused proofs, a normal form of cut-free sequent calculus proofs, to that of maximally multi-focused proofs. We validate this deﬁnition by proving a bijection to the well-known proof-nets for {MLL} and discussing the possibility of a similar correspondence for the still open problem of proof-nets for {MALL} with units.},

  abstract     = {The sequent calculus is often criticized for requiring proofs to contain large amounts of low-level syntactic details that can obscure the essence of a given proof. Because each inference rule introduces only a single connective, sequent proofs can separate closely related steps—such as instantiating a block of quantiﬁers—by irrelevant noise. Moreover, the sequential nature of sequent proofs forces proof steps that are syntactically non-interfering and permutable to nevertheless be written in some arbitrary order. The sequent calculus thus lacks a notion of canonicity: proofs that should be considered essentially the same may not have a common syntactic form. To ﬁx this problem, many researchers have proposed replacing the sequent calculus with proof structures that are more parallel or geometric. Proof-nets, matings, and atomic ﬂows are examples of such revolutionary formalisms. We propose, instead, an evolutionary approach to recover canonicity within the sequent calculus, which we illustrate for classical ﬁrst-order logic. The essential element of our approach is the use of a multi-focused sequent calculus as the means for abstracting away low-level details from classical cut-free sequent proofs. We show that, among the multi-focused proofs, the maximally multi-focused proofs that collect together all possible parallel foci are canonical. Moreover, if we start with a certain focused sequent proof system, such proofs are isomorphic to expansion proofs—a well known, minimalistic, and parallel generalization of Herbrand disjunctions—for classical ﬁrst-order logic. This technique appears to be a systematic way to recover the “essence of proof” from within sequent calculus proofs.},

The book will be relevant to Peirce scholars, mathematicians, and philosophers alike, thanks to thorough assessments of Peirce's mathematical heritage, compact surveys of the literature, and new perspectives offered through formal and modern mathematizations of the topics studied.},

    The (elementary) theory of topoi is the basis for the study of continuously variable structures as classical set theory is the basis for the study of constant structures. Sheaves on a coherent topological space also occur in algebraic geometry. This chapter illustrates that algebraic geometry is equal to geometric logic. Each can be transformed into the other on the basis of the fact that both are the studies of continuous maps between coherent topoi. This claim metaphysically ignores the dominating aspect in algebraic geometry of calculations in linear algebra. Logic should be regarded as including the formalism of closed categories, whereas the form of the linear algebra calculations in geometry is that of (abelian and) closed categories.}

We report on a new, generic, simple, and flexible approach for automated generation of illustrated proofs. The proofs are generated using Larus, an automated prover for coherent logic, and corresponding illustrations are generated in the GCLC language. Animated illustrations are also supported.},

Assigning static and, to varying degree, dynamic meaning to programs with holes allows program editors and other tools to oﬀer meaningful feedback and assistance throughout editing, i.e. in a live manner. Prior work, however, has considered only holes appearing in expressions and types. This paper considers, from type theoretic and logical ﬁrst principles, the problem of typed pattern holes. We confront two main diﬃculties, (1) statically reasoning about exhaustiveness and irredundancy when patterns are not fully known, and (2) live evaluation of expressions containing both pattern and expression holes. In both cases, this requires reasoning conservatively about all possible hole ﬁllings. We develop a typed lambda calculus, Peanut, where reasoning about exhaustiveness and redundancy is mapped to the problem of deriving ﬁrst order entailments. We equip Peanut with an operational semantics in the style of Hazelnut Live that allows us to evaluate around holes in both expressions and patterns. We mechanize the metatheory of Peanut in Agda and formalize a procedure capable of deciding the necessary entailments. Finally, we scale up and implement these mechanisms within Hazel, a programming environment for a dialect of Elm that automatically inserts holes during editing to provide static and dynamic feedback to the programmer in a maximally live manner, i.e. for every possible editor state. Hazel is the ﬁrst maximally live environment for a general-purpose functional language. CCS Concepts: • Software and its engineering → Functional languages; Patterns.},

Although the proof theory and metatheory of BI are mathematically involved, the formalization of important metatheoretical results is still incipient. In this paper we present a self-contained formalized, in the Coq proof assistant, proof of a central metatheoretical property of BI: cut elimination for its sequent calculus. The presented proof is semantic, in the sense that is obtained by interpreting sequents in a particular “universal” model. This results in a more modular and elegant proof than a standard Gentzen-style cut elimination argument, which can be subtle and error-prone in manual proofs for BI. In particular, our semantic approach avoids unnecessary inversions on proof derivations, or the uses of cut reductions and the multi-cut rule. Besides modular, our approach is also robust: we demonstrate how our method scales, with minor modifications, to (i) an extension of BI with an arbitrary set of simple structural rules, and (ii) an extension with an S4-like □ modality.},

However, deep applicability of the inference rules causes greater nondeterminism than in the sequent calculus regarding proof search. In this paper, we introduce a new technique which reduces nondeterminism without breaking proof theoretical properties and provides a more immediate access to shorter proofs. We present this technique on system BV, the smallest technically non-trivial system in the calculus of structures, extending multiplicative linear logic with the rules mix, nullary mix, and a self-dual non-commutative logical operator. Because our technique exploits a scheme common to all the systems in the calculus of structures, we argue that it generalizes to these systems for classical logic, linear logic, and modal logics.},

We show that it is sound and complete with respect to the usual sequent calculus, and consider a restricted system for a smaller class of formulas. Then, we encode lambda-terms with explicit substitutions in these formulas and exhibit a correspondence between proof search in this system and reduction in a lambda-calculus with explicit substitutions. Finally, we present a further restriction to allow a correspondence with the standard lambda-calculus, and show that we can prove results on lambda-calculi by proving results on derivations in the proof systems.},

We show how to apply the focusing technique to nested sequent calculi, a generalization of ordinary sequent calculi to tree-like instead of list-like structures. We thus improve the reach of focusing to the most commonly studied modal logics, the logics of the modal S5 cube. Among our key contributions is a focused cut-elimination theorem for focused nested sequents.},

The salient feature of this structure is that its elements can be seen both as truth values and as (generalized) realizers, thus blurring the frontier between proofs and types. We show that each implicative algebra induces a (Set-based) tripos, using a construction that is reminiscent from the construction of a realizability tripos from a partial combinatory algebra. Relating this construction with the corresponding constructions in forcing and realizability, we conclude that the class of implicative triposes encompass all forcing triposes (both intuitionistic and classical), all classical realizability triposes (in the sense of Krivine) and all intuitionistic realizability triposes built from partial combinatory algebras.},

The search technique is based on notions of paths and connections and thus avoids redundancies in the search space. During the proof search the computed first-order and intuitionistic substitutions are used to simultaneously construct a sequent proof which is more human oriented than the matrix proof. This allows to use our method within interactive proof environments. Furthermore we can consider local substitutions instead of global ones and treat substitutions occurring in different branches of the sequent proof independently. This reduces the number of extra copies of formulae to be considered.},

  abstract    = {This thesis introduces the "method of structural refinement", which serves as a means of transforming the relational semantics of a modal and/or constructive logic into an 'economical' proof system by connecting two proof-theoretic paradigms: labelled and nested sequent calculi. The formalism of labelled sequents has been successful in that cut-free calculi in possession of desirable proof-theoretic properties can be automatically generated for large classes of logics. Despite these qualities, labelled systems make use of a complicated syntax that explicitly incorporates the semantics of the associated logic, and such systems typically violate the subformula property to a high degree. By contrast, nested sequent calculi employ a simpler syntax and adhere to a strict reading of the subformula property, making such systems useful in the design of automated reasoning algorithms. However, the downside of the nested sequent paradigm is that a general theory concerning the automated construction of such calculi (as in the labelled setting) is essentially absent, meaning that the construction of nested systems and the confirmation of their properties is usually done on a case-by-case basis. The refinement method connects both paradigms in a fruitful way, by transforming labelled systems into nested (or, refined labelled) systems with the properties of the former preserved throughout the transformation process. To demonstrate the method of refinement and some of its applications, we consider grammar logics, first-order intuitionistic logics, and deontic STIT logics. The introduced refined labelled calculi will be used to provide the first proof-search algorithms for deontic STIT logics. Furthermore, we employ our refined labelled calculi for grammar logics to show that every logic in the class possesses the effective Lyndon interpolation property.},

These results are achieved by providing a notion of barbed bisimilarity for interaction nets which is general enough to adapt to all systems but is still concrete enough to allow (hopefully) convincing separation results. This is itself a contribution of the paper.},

These links are used by the system to rewrite the goal in a way that reflects the intention of the user performing the manipulation. Because PBL avoids the use of proof languages, the same technique can potentially be used as a frontend to any existing formal reasoning system, making PBL a universal interaction method. In this paper we substantiate this claim by showing how to extract formal proofs from PBL derivations in a variety of existing proof languages, using a variety of techniques including reflection, combinators, and meta-programming. Crucially, all our extraction procedures use the native notions of propositions/formulas in the target proof systems, which makes the PBL technique compatible with the existing proof building machinery in these systems. We also provide implementations of the extraction procedures in an extension of the Profint framework, which runs on the client side in any modern web-browser.},

Tom is a pattern matching processor that integrates term rewriting facilities into imperative languages. In this paper, relying on the correspondence between the systems in the calculus of structures and term rewriting systems, we present an implementation of system BV of the calculus of structures in Java by exploiting the term rewriting features of Tom. This way, by means of the expressive power due to Java, it becomes possible to implement different search strategies. Since the systems in the calculus of structures follow a common scheme, we argue that our implementation can be generalized to other systems in the calculus of structures for classical logic, modal logics, and different fragments of linear logic.},

Deep inference provides a richer combinatoric analysis of proofs for diﬀerent logics. In particular, construction of exponentially shorter proofs becomes possible. In this paper, aiming at the development of computation as proof search tools, we propose the Maude language as a means for designing and implementing diﬀerent deep inference deductive systems and proof strategies that work on these systems.

Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a promising approach to GUI design, providing high-level, declarative, compositional abstractions to describe user interactions and time-dependent computations. We present Elm, a practical FRP language focused on easy creation of responsive GUIs. Elm has two major features: simple declarative support for Asynchronous FRP; and purely functional graphical layout.Asynchronous FRP allows the programmer to specify when the global ordering of event processing can be violated, and thus enables efficient concurrent execution of FRP programs; long-running computation can be executed asynchronously and not adversely affect the responsiveness of the user interface.Layout in Elm is achieved using a purely functional declarative framework that makes it simple to create and combine text, images, and video into rich multimedia displays.Together, Elm's two major features simplify the complicated task of creating responsive and usable GUIs.},

Our search algorithm outputs either a proof or a ﬁnite counter-model, thus, additionally establishing the ﬁnite model property for intuitionistic S4, which has been another long-standing open problem in the area.},

We introduce a Curry–Howard correspondence between well-formed interaction nets and a deep-inference deduction system based on linear logic. In particular, linear logic itself is easily expressed in the system and its computational aspects materialise though the correspondence. The system of interaction nets obtained is a typed variant of already well-known sharing graphs. Due to a strong confluence property, strong normalisation for this system follows from weak normalisation. The latter is obtained via an adaptation of Girard's reducibility method. The approach is modular, readily gives rise to generalisations (e.g. second order, known as polymorphism to the programmer) and could therefore be extended to various systems of interaction nets.},

  title    = {Dependently {Typed} {Functional} {Programs} and their {Proofs}},
  url      = {https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/374},
  abstract = {Research in dependent type theories [ML71a] has, in the past, concentrated on its use in the presentation of theorems and theorem-proving. This thesis is concerned mainly with the exploitation of the computational aspects of type theory for programming, in a context where the properties of programs may readily be specified and established. In particular, it develops technology for programming with dependent inductive families of datatypes and proving those programs correct. It demonstrates the considerable advantage to be gained by indexing data structures with pertinent characteristic information whose soundness is ensured by typechecking, rather than human effort.  
    Type theory traditionally presents safe and terminating computation on inductive datatypes by means of elimination rules which serve as induction principles and, via their associated reduction behaviour, recursion operators [Dyb91]. In the programming language arena, these appear somewhat cumbersome and give rise to unappealing code, complicated by the inevitable interaction between case analysis on dependent types and equational reasoning on their indices which must appear explicitly in the terms. Thierry Coquand's proposal [Coq92] to equip type theory directly with the kind of pattern matching notation to which functional programmers have become used over the past three decades [Bur69, McB70] offers a remedy to many of these difficulties. However, the status of pattern matching relative to the traditional elimination rules has until now been in doubt. Pattern matching implies the uniqueness of identity proofs, which Martin Hofmann showed underivable from the conventional definition of equality [Hof95]. This thesis shows that the adoption of this uniqueness as axiomatic is sufficient t make pattern matching admissible.  
      A datatype's elimination rule allows abstraction only over the whole inductively defined family. In order to support pattern matching, the application of such rules to specific instances of dependent families has been systematised. The underlying analysis extends beyond datatypes to other rules of a similar second order character, suggesting they may have other roles to play in the specification, verification and, perhaps, derivation of programs. The technique developed shifts the specificity from the instantiation of the type's indices into equational constraints on indices freely chosen, allowing the elimination rule to be applied.  
      Elimination by this means leaves equational hypothesis in the resulting subgoals, which must be solved if further progress is to be made. The first-order unification algorithm for constructor forms in simple types presented in [McB96] has been extended to cover dependent datatypes as well, yielding completely automated solution to a class of problems which can be syntactically defined.  
      The justification and operation of these techniques requires the machine to construct and exploit a standardised collection of auxiliary lemmas for each datatype. This is greatly facilitated by two technical developments of interest in their own right:  
      a more convenient definition of equality, with a relaxed formulation rule allowing elements of different types to be compared, but nonetheless equivalent to the usual equality plus the axiom of uniqueness; 
    a type theory, OLEG, which incorporates incomplete objects, accounting for their `holes' entirely within the typing judgments and, novelly, not requiring any notion of explicit substitution to manage their scopes.  
      A substantial prototype has been implemented, extending the proof assistant LEGO [LP92]. A number of programs are developed by way of example. Chiefly, the increased expressivity of dependent datatypes is shown to capture a standard first-order unification algorithm within the class of structurally recursive programs, removing any need for a termination argument. Furthermore, the use of elimination rules in specifying the components of the program simplifies significantly its correctness proof.},

Although sign theories have along history, Peirce’s accounts are distinctive and innovative fortheir breadth and complexity, and for capturing the importance ofinterpretation to signification. For Peirce, developing athoroughgoing theory of signs was a central philosophical andintellectual preoccupation. The importance of semiotic for Peirce iswide ranging. As he himself said, “[…] it has never beenin my power to study anything, – mathematics, ethics, metaphysics,gravitation, thermodynamics, optics, chemistry, comparative anatomy,astronomy, psychology, phonetics, economics, the history of science,whist, men and women, wine, metrology, except as a study ofsemiotic” (SS 1977, 85–6). Peirce also treated sign theoryas central to his work on logic, as the medium for inquiry and theprocess of scientific discovery, and even as one possible means for‘proving’ his pragmatism. Its importance in Peirce’s philosophy, then,cannot be overestimated.},

  abstract = {Subformula linking is a technique that allows one to simplify proof goals by identifying subformulas of hypotheses that share atoms with the goal. It has been used by recent prototypes for gesture-based interactive theorem proving, but also for theorem proving in separation logic. When linking formulas, we should avoid information loss, i.e., subformula linking should succeed precisely when a provable simplification can be generated. Avoiding information loss is challenging when quantifiers are involved. Existing approaches either generate simplifications that involve equalities, or determine substitutions for variables via unification. The first approach can produce unprovable simplifications, while the second approach can fail to find desired links. We propose a third approach, called Quantifying on the Uninstantiated (QU), which is also based on unification and lies between the two existing approaches. We show that QU has practical applications for proof automation, by improving tactics for resource framing in the Iris framework for separation logic in Coq.},

    proof editor for first-order intuitionistic predicate calculus, developed at the 
      University of Edinburgh during 1983-1986, by the author together with John 
      Cartmell and Tatsuya Hagino. The IPE uses an attribute grammar to maintain 
      the state of its proof tree as a context-sensitive structure. The interface 
      allows free movement through the proof structure, and encourages a "proof-byexperimentation" 
      approach, since no proof step is irrevocable. 
      We describe how the IPE's proof rules can be derived from natural deduction 
      rules for first-order intuitionistic logic, how these proof rules are encoded as an 
      attribute grammar, and how the interface is constructed on top of the grammar. 
      Further facilities for the manipulation of the IPE's proof structures are presented, 
    including a notion of IPE-tactic for their automatic construction. 
      We also describe an extension of the IPE to enable the construction and 
      use of simply-structured collections of axioms and results, the main provision 
      here being an interactive "theory browser" which looks for facts which match a 
      selected problem.},

With rare exceptions such as Peirce's alpha and beta systems, purely diagrammatic formal reasoning has not been in the mathematician's or logician's toolkit. This paper develops a purely diagrammatic reasoning system of “spider diagrams” that builds on Euler, Venn and Peirce diagrams. The system is known to be expressively equivalent to first-order monadic logic with equality. Two levels of diagrammatic syntax have been developed: an ‘abstract’ syntax that captures the structure of diagrams, and a ‘concrete’ syntax that captures topological properties of drawn diagrams. A number of simple diagrammatic transformation rules are given, and the resulting reasoning system is shown to be sound and complete.},

The nested systems we obtain incorporate propagation rules that are parameterized with formal grammars, and which encode certain frame conditions expressible as first-order Horn formulae that correspond to a subclass of the Scott-Lemmon axioms.

Interestingly, the Maehara-style translation for proving soundness syntactically fails due to the hierarchical structure of nested sequents. Consequently, we only provide the semantic proof of soundness. The countermodel construction used to prove completeness required a completely novel approach to deal with two independent sources of nontermination in the proof search present in the case of transitive and Euclidean logics.},
